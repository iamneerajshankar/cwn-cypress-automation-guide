What is Iframe ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An iframe, short for "inline frame," is an HTML element used to embed another HTML document within the current document

It allows you to include external content, such as web pages, videos, or other documents, within the context of your 
own web page. Iframes are often used to display content from different sources while maintaining the separation of 
the two documents.

Key points about iframes:

1. Embedding External Content: The primary purpose of an iframe is to embed external content into a web page. This 
   external content can come from the same domain or from a different domain (cross-origin iframes). This makes iframes 
   useful for displaying content from third-party sources, like embedded YouTube videos or social media widgets.

2. Isolation: An iframe provides isolation between the content inside the iframe and the surrounding web page. CSS styles 
   and JavaScript code in the parent document do not affect the content inside the iframe, and vice versa. This isolation is 
   a security feature that prevents malicious code from affecting the parent page.

3. Size and Dimensions: You can specify the size and dimensions of an iframe, allowing you to control how much space the 
   embedded content occupies on your web page.
